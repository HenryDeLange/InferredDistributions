# InferredDistributions
A proof of concept project to see whether it is possible to infer the distribution range of a species based on the recorded observations on iNaturalist using neural networks.


# Example Output
### Brown-Hooded Kingfisher
Below is the map generated by the Neural Network.

# Notes
While working on this I learnt that, to no surprise, this isn't a new concept and there are many other tools and research projects with similar ideas.
